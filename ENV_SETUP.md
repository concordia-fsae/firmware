** the script will set up the env for compiling - no need to run twice ** 
** to test new changes, simply enter container shell and execute scons - the files will update automatically due to mounitng feature ** 
** this also means that, once built, the build dir will be on your local machine as well. Run scons --clean in container if you want to re-build from scratch **

Local changes
