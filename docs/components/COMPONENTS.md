# Component Folder and File Hierarchy

## Sections

- _Each component is broken into 3 main code sources_

1. Source Code
    - The source code is located in `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/` for each component
    - Hardware sources to be included `./components/$DESIGNATOR/HW/mcuConfig.yaml`
    - The source code, while it varies between component, has these typical areas:
        1. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/build/`
            - Contains all object files, binary files, etc...
        2. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/generated/`
            - Contains code generated by scripts and/or programs which is used by the embedded system
        3. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/HW/`
            - Contains all firmware source code and header files which interfaces between System Calls and the Hardware
        4. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/include/`
            - Contains all System and Application header files
        5. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/lib/`
            - Contains any library source code and header files which the System uses
        6. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/RTOS`
            -Contains all source code and header files relating to the implementation of the System's RTOS
        7. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/src`
            - Contains all System and Application level source code
        8. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/SConscript`
            - Is called by `./SConstruct` to run the component build script
2. Embedded System
    - Contains libraries, openocd configurations, and platform code accessible to all devices located in `./embedded/`
    - Select important sections:
        1. `./embedded/libs/CMSIS/`: Controller independant system level library
            - Used for RTOS and other controller independant systems
            - FSAE does not have control of code-base
        2. `./embedded/platforms/`: Supported Hardware and MCU platforms
            - Contains the HAL/LL, startup code, and link script for the STM32 family of devices in `./embedded/platforms/stm32/` 
            - FSAE does not have control of code-base
3. Chip Configuration
    - The chip configuration is stored in YAML files in `./site_scons/chips.yaml` and `./site_scons/components.yaml`
    - `./site_scons/chips.yaml` contains the configuration of the chip source files and headers to be included by the build system 
    - `./site_scons/components.yaml` contains the different components and their sources for the build system
