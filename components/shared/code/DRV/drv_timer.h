/**
 * @file drv_timer.h
 * @brief  Header file for the timer library
 * @note To use this driver, declare and initialize a timer. The timer can be
 * started, stopped, and evaluated with the different utility functions in this
 * driver.
 *
 * Setup
 * 1. Declare a timer
 * 2. Initialize the timer
 *
 * Usage
 * - A timer can be stopped, running, or expired. An expired timer will still tick
 *   and increment the elapsed time, however a stopped timer will always return an
 *   elapsed time of 0
 * - To run the timer for some amount of time, start the timer with the amount of
 *   time until the timer should be expired.
 * - To count the amount of time from a given point, a timer can be started with
 *   an arbitrary runtime. It will expire at that arbitrary amount of time, however
 *   the timer will still increase the elapsed time. It is suggested to use a
 *   runtime_ms of 0.
 * - Retrieve the state of a timer with the getState function
 * - Retrieve the amount of time in ms since the timer was started with the
 *   getElapsedTimeMs function
