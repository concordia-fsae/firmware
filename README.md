## Sections

- _Each component is broken into 3 main code sources_

1. Source Code
    - The source code is typically located in `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/` for each component
    - Hardware sources to be included `./components/$DESIGNATOR/HW/mcuConfig.yaml` unless multiple platforms are supported
    - The source code, while it varies between component, has these typical areas:
        1. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/build/`
            - Contains all object files, binary files, etc...
        2. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/generated/`
            - Contains code generated by scripts and/or programs which is used by the embedded system
        3. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/HW/`
            - Contains all firmware source code and header files which interfaces between System Calls and the Hardware
        4. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/include/`

        7. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/src`
            - Contains all System and Application level source code
        8. `./components/$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR/SConscript`
            - Is called by `./SConstruct` to run the component build script
        9. `./components/shared/`: Team libraries, configurations, drivers, firmware, and other...
2. Embedded System
    - Contains libraries, openocd configurations, and platform code accessible to all devices located in `./embedded/`
    - Select important sections:
        1. `./embedded/libs/CMSIS/`: Controller independant system level library
            - Used for RTOS and other controller independant systems
        2. `./embedded/platforms/`: Supported Hardware and MCU platforms
            - Contains the HAL/LL, startup code, and link script for the STM32 family of devices in `./embedded/platforms/stm32/`
3. Chip Configuration
    - The chip configuration is stored in YAML files in `./site_scons/chips.yaml` and `./site_scons/components.yaml`
    - `./site_scons/chips.yaml` contains the configuration of the chip source files and headers to be included by the build system
    - `./site_scons/components.yaml` contains the different components and their sources for the build system
    - `./site_scons/platforms.yaml` contains the different platforms and their component composition

# Setting Up and Using the Development Environment

## Workflows

### 1. Installation and Set-Up

1. Clone repository
    - Clone with ssh link. This enables ssh when pushing and pulling
2. Pull in submodules
    - `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Install and start docker (OS-specific)
    - **Windows Users**: Install bash emulator: cygwin, mingw64, WSL (test optimal tool)
4. Install docker compose (OS-specific)
5. Execute docker script from root directory
    - `./buildroot.sh`
        * Change permissions if necessary: `chmod +x buildroot.sh`
        * **Note**: It has been noticed that a bug on windows and mac hosts creates unexpected build failures. Known workaround is to run it from a linux virtual machine.

### 2. Container Usage

- _All components, and their designator, are listed in `./site_scons/components.yaml`_

1. Building the program(s)
    - Execute the SCons program from inside the env
        - `scons --targets=$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR build` is to build single components
            - ex: To build the stw, execute `scons --targets=stw build`. Build is the default action for a target and therefore does not need to be specified
            - Note: `build` is the default target, so `scons --target=bmsb` is analogous to `scons --target=bmsb build`
            - Build targets can be seperated by a pound `#`
            - The config ID of a component can be specified with a colon `:` and can be seperated with a comma `,`
            - An example of a complex build is `scons --targetsbmsb:0#bmsw:1,2`
        - `scons --platform=$PLATFORM_DESIGNATOR` is to build an entire platform
2. Uploading the program over SWD (Optional)
    - The SCons build environment has an optional upload command that flashes the device and holds
    - To flash and verify, execute `scons --targets=$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR --upload` from the env
3. Debugging the program
    - _More information and better debugging workflows can be found by researching OpenOCD and GDB commands_
    - Debugging in the env is done through GDB and OpenOCD
    - To start the OpenOCD server and connect to the remote host in GDB, execute:
        - `scons --targets=$COMPONENT_DESIGNATOR --debugger` from the env
        - You can chain multiple commands together. For example: 'scons --target=stw upload openocd-gdb' will build, upload, and start the debugger
    - The standard GDB commands apply. To reset or halt the MCU through the SWD connection, execute:
        - `monitor reset`, `monitor reset halt`
    - _It is always good when you first open the env to execute `st-info --probe` to see if the ST-LINK is recognized_

## Sections

1. SCons Tools
    - Located in `./site_scons/site_tools/`
    - Custom python scripts added to the SCons build environment
2. Embedded Systems
    1. Toolchains
        - Downloaded from ARM Developper
        - Located in `./embedded/toolchains`
    2. USB Loader/Debugger
        - Located in `./embedded/openocd`
        - Interfaces and stores configurations of different chips/boards
    3. Platforms
        - Supported hardware platforms
        - Located in `./embedded/platforms/`
4. SCons related scripts
    - `./SConstruct`
    - `./components/$DESIGNATOR/Sconscript`

## Notes

- The script will set up the env for compiling - no need to run twice
- Due to the mounting feature of the docker container, anytime the container is open the changes applied to the files will automatically and immediately be accessible to the SCons tool
    - This also means that, once built, the build dir will be on your local machine as well. Run scons --clean in container if you want to re-build from scratch
- If doing loading/debugging of physical hardware, the ST-LINK or other interface must be plugged in by USB before starting the container. Docker containers do not support dynamic loading of USB peripherals
    - Note: This only works if no bootloader is installed. If a bootloader is installed and you are debugging through JTAG, you should still flash over CAN

# Programming Guidelines

_Internal file templates and section templates located in `./shared/templates/`_

## Rules

- Use good **modular design**. Think carefully about the program structure, functions, and data structures before starting to write the code
- Use proper **error detection** and handling. Always check return values from functions and handle errors appropriately. `Error_Handler()` is not proper error handling for production level code (typically).
- If the component uses dynamic memory allocation (typically, we do not support dynamic memory allocation in this framework) you must have code somewhere in the program to release memory.
- Use **descriptive names** for functions and important variables. GetRadius() should be used instead of foo() for a function that returns the radius of a circle.
- **Define constants** and use them, especially for configuration values. If you have a buffer and decide it should be 100 units long, then:

    **Compliant**
    ```
    #define BUFFER_SIZE 50U
    ...
    uint8_t buf[BUFFER_SIZE];
    ```

    **Non Compliant**
    ```
    uint8_t buf[50];
    ```

- Keep each variable to the **smallest scope possible**. Do not have a variable global to a file if it is only used from one function. Avoid using global variables
- Use **standard types** such as `uint8_t`, `int32_t`, etc... Do not use `int` or `unsigned int`.
- Application level code should not contain system level details. System level code should not contain firmware level details. Etc... Utilize a **top-down design**
- **Line length** should be kept relative. While we believe in monitors with unlimited width, do not have a line 200 characters long. A good rule of thumd is roughly 100 characters long, or just a bit biggetr than a section heading.
- **Documment your code**, if you are doing something ambiguous, something that relates to hardware details, etc... detail the execution flow of your program. If you know what it does great, but once you are no longer on the team your knowledge will not help the next person unless you look forward to babysitting (for **free**)
    - Every file, function, etc... should be documented in line with the **Documentation Guidelines**
- Only **single assignment per line**, if assigning multiple items do it over multiple lines

    **Compliant**
    ```
    uint32_t a, b, c;
    a = 0;
    b = a;
    c = a;
    ```

    **Non Compliant**
    ```
    uint32_t a, b, c;
    a = b = c = 0;
    ```

- Use proper **formatting**. Formatting details can be found in `.clang-format`

### File Sections

- Each file is broken into sections such as Includes, Defines, etc...
- An empty line is to follow and come before the section header

    **Compliant Code**
    ```
    /******************************************************************************
     *                              D E F I N E S

    #define ADC_CALIBRATION_TIMEOUT                    10U

    /******************************************************************************
     *                           P U B L I C  V A R S
     ******************************************************************************/
    ```
    **Non-Compliant Code**

    ```
    /******************************************************************************

## Documentation Guidelines

_To be used with doxygen-style comments_

- Some detailed rules are listed below to illustrate the comments format for each function:
    - The comments block shall start with /** (slash-asterisk-asterisk) in a single line.
    - The comments block shall end with */ (space-asterisk-slash) in a single line.
    - Other than the first line and the last line, every line inside the comments block shall start with * (space-asterisk). It also applies to the line which is used to separate different paragraphs. We’ll call it a blank line for simplicity.
    - Single line comments shall be C-style `// Code comment`
1. **Files**
    - Each file must contain a header which details the file name and a brief description at a minimum

        **Compliant**
        ```
        /* in header.h */
        /**
        * @file header.h
        * @brief  Details the configuration of this implementation
        */
        ```

        **Non Compliant**
        ```
        /* in header.h */
        // This code houses the configuration
        ```
2. **Functions**
    - For each function, following information shall be documented: brief description, detailed description, parameters description, pre-conditions, post-conditions, return value description, and comments explaining the actual return values. We’ll call each block of information a paragraph for simplicity. A paragraph may be removed from the list if it is not applicable for that function.
    - Each line shall only contain the description for one parameter, or one pre-condition, or one post-condition, or one actual return value. We’ll call each of these an element for simplicity.
    - A blank line shall separate different paragraphs. Inside each paragraph, a blank line is not required to separate each element.
    - The brief description of the function shall be documented with the format @brief <brief description>.
    - No specific format is required for the detailed description of the function.
    - The description of the function parameter shall be documented with the format @param <parameter name> <parameter description>.
    - The pre-condition of the function shall be documented with the format @pre <pre-condition description>.
    - The post-condition of the function shall be documented with the format @post <post-condition description>.
    - The brief description of the function return value shall be documented with the format @return <brief description of return value>.
    - A void-returning function shall be documented with the format @return None.
    - The comments explaining the actual return values shall be documented with the format @retval <return value> <return value explanation>.
    - If the description of one element needs to span multiple lines, each line shall be aligned to the start of the description in the first line for that element.
    - The comments block shall appear immediately before the function definition/declaration in the C source file or header file.
